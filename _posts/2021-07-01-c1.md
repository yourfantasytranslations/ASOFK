"Wingardium Leviosa… Wingardium Leviosa… Uh! Still not working! It seems that I can't master the wandless cast of the Levitating Spell before setting off… Um! Tonight I shall practice Illusion!"

In the elegantly decorated bedroom, a delicate boy muttered these words, having an expression of disappointment on his face.

At this moment, a pleasant female voice called him from the outside, "Hey! Zhang Hao, hurry up! We have to go to Gringotts to exchange to Galleons!"

Zhang Hao was the name of the boy. He said helplessly, "Okay sis! Give me a minute!"

One minute later, his cousin urged again, "Zhang Hao, come and eat! We really don't have time!"

Zhang Hao came out from the bedroom and said lazily, "I said 'give me a minute' sis! You are not in a hurry to see your boyfriend, are you? I have to remind you that even if you are in a hurry, it's useless! Because the Hogwarts train does not leave earlier than scheduled even if you arrived one second early!"

The girl replied in an irritated voice, "What nonsense are you talking about? I don't have a boyfriend!"

"Oh..." Zhang Hao dragged the long tone, as if he had discovered something, and said wisely, "Since you are not in a hurry to see your boyfriend, you must be hoping to do some shopping. Do you want me to pay for it?"

As soon as he said this, the girl picking up the tableware blushed immediately. She quibbled, "Nonsense! I just want to take you around London, after all, you just arrived here!"

Zhang Hao shook his head helplessly, and did not continue to expose someone's shortcomings. He sat elegantly at the dining table and began to enjoy someone's dark dishes.

While eating, the girl became anxious and said, "Zhang Hao, you are going to Hogwarts to learn magic, is your company taken care of? Hmm! You must not go bankrupt! Or I won't have the money to buy the clothes I like!"

Zhang Hao weakly replied: "Sure enough, you still remember the size of my wallet! Don't worry! My company has top professional managers to take care of it, so I can continue making money and I will never go bankrupt!"

Hearing this, his cousin became happy and said, "That's great! I have heard that all your companies are established by yourself. You are only eleven years old! What a genius!"

Zhang Hao was a bit noncommittal. He could achieve so many achievements at the age of eleven, which was not something an ordinary person can do!

At this point, Zhang Hao couldn't help but think of his bizarre experience.

Eleven years ago, Zhang Hao, who came from another world, was born to an ordinary family in China in the 1980s.

Coincidentally, this family also had the Zhang family name. And even more coincidentally, he was given the name 'Zhang Hao' again.

'Who has no regrets in life? The answer is no one, and no one would dislike re-birth.'

Zhang Hao was the same, rebirth was a surprise to him!

But more surprisingly, he still had a cheat skill like his previous life. A mysterious illusion that could be opened at night! In this mysterious illusion, the flow of time was a hundred times faster than reality, and one day could be used as one hundred days.

In the mysterious illusion, you could do whatever you want and manifest everything! Reading, doing scientific research, practicing talent…

With the help of the various functions of the mysterious illusion, Zhang Hao had learned and mastered more than ten practical majors in literature, mathematics, music, painting, English, and programming in just eleven years.

He had written theme songs for several TV dramas, and had written songs for more than a dozen popular movie stars, thus quickly accumulating profit more than the original capital.

Then, with his superb programming skills, he developed a series of internet gold-absorbing tools such as HQ social software, large-scale online game "Legend", and the hottest literature terminal.

Then, he integrated all of these industries to establish Ritian Group and became the richest man in China.

The media from all over the world called him the miracle boy on this day!

Some people even predicted that he would definitely reach the top of the world in the future!

But at this moment, a letter opened the door to a new world for him.

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry

Headmaster Albus Dumbledore

(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)

Dear Mr. Hao Zhang:

We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Upon receiving this letter, Zhang Hao couldn't help but widen his eyes. 'What should I do if I have money? Of course, I think of ways to live longer!'

'I didn't get to spend a lot of money until I died, so I'm heartbroken!'

But in this era, money could last long, but money couldn't make you live forever!

Want to live forever? You have to rely on supernatural powers!

In this case, Hogwarts' invitation was exactly what he needed.

And learning magic was a new challenge for Zhang Hao who was getting bored.

He couldn't wait to find his family to share this good news, but he didn't expect his parents to be very calm about the matter.

"That's it? Go to London to find your cousin Cho Chang, she is also studying at Hogwarts."

That's right!

The cousin in front him was Cho Chang, the Chinese goddess in Harry Potter.

Zhang Hao only discovered at that time that the family he was involved in was not that simple.
