Chapter 1 - The strongest playing system in the heavens

"Hiss."

Wu Chen slowly opened his eyes, only to feel a numbing pain on the back of his head.

He raised his hand to support his head and sat up. Immediately afterward, he noticed the unusual situation around him.
His eyes took over the scene around him; night streets lined with tall buildings on both sides. When his gaze fell at his feet, he realised he was sitting right on top of the sidewalk.

"Where is this? Wasn't I working overtime at the company?" Wu Chen murmured, startled, and jumped to his feet.

He remembered very clearly that his project was about to be accepted, but the final inspection work had not yet been done, so Wu Chen's group was working overnight to finish it up.

It seems that he fell asleep while working and then woke up in this place?

Could it be that he's dreaming?

"ROAR!!!"

Not far away came an earth-shattering roar, as if a monster was going crazy.

Then came a very loud shout, "Hulk!" 

The colossal roar produced tremendous vibrations, and the wound on the back of his head pulsated. The numbing pain resurfaced, serving as a reminder to Wu Chen that this was real.

An unfamiliar memory came to his mind. Wu Chen looked at the fist-sized blood-stained stone near him as if to understand the situation.

This was New York, USA, and he is the owner of a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan.

His name is still Wu Chen, with a handsome appearance, but the world is not the world it once was.

In his memory, Wu Chen saw the headquarters building of Stark Industries and saw Tony Stark very frankly saying at a press conference, "I am Iron Man!"

This is the Marvel world!

According to those memories, this was the Marvel movie world.
At once, Wu Chen let out a sigh of relief... Hah!

Compared to the Marvel Comics world, the Marvel movie world is undoubtedly a few notches weaker overall in power level.

But even if it's considered weak, it's not to the level that ordinary people can resist.

Now that the Iron Man has appeared, doesn't that mean the Hulk, Thor, Hydra, and even the Exterminator will show up?


Wu Chen could sense the wave of bad luck approaching. He did not want to bet on the probability of coming across them since he knew he would definitely become ash scattered on the ground.

But, as an ordinary person, what can he do?

He thought of the reason he was lying on the ground at the moment.

He'd gone out to buy something, and then suddenly there was a loud bang. A fist-sized stone flew far over and hit him directly on the back of the head.

"I'm too unlucky!"

Boom!

The wall that was not too far away from Wu Chen was reduced to pieces as another rock shot towards him.

He hurriedly dodged it while angrily glaring over towards the source of the rock.
But the next second, he froze. Then, in a split second, he ran like he was on fire. 

After the wall broke open, an ugly green giant more than three meters tall appeared in Wu Chen's sight. It was none other than the one who caused Wu Chen's injury.

He also recognized its identity - the Abomination!

In order to capture the Hulk, General Ross formed a team with Emil Blonsky, who, in pursuit of greater power, exposed himself to gamma radiation and became the extremely ugly, but very vicious, and incomparably powerful Abomination!

This moment is the time when Blonsky turned into Abomination. Although he became powerful, he also lost all reason, crazy enough to destroy everything around, and wanting to fight with the Hulk!

Powerful physical instincts allowed Blonsky to feel the thrill of destruction.

He flipped the cars around him one by one before flinging them away violently, smashing pedestrians and vehicles.

"Ah!!! Help!"

The cries of innocent people shook the sky as police officers arrived and shot at the Abomination, but to no avail.

Pow!

A car fell head-on to several police officers, who tried to dodge but died instantly.

Wu Chen witnessed this scene, only to feel a pent-up feeling in his heart that refused to leave.

Abomination, in order to attract Hulk over, ruthlessly destroyed everything, without caring about anything. This is truly evil!

"Mom! I want mommy!!!"

Suddenly, a little girl's cries sounded behind him. Wu Chen stopped his escape and turned his head to look over.

He saw a five or six-year-old blonde girl lying on the ground. In front of her was a blonde woman lying in a pool of blood. And behind her was Abomination, carrying a car!

Wu Chen's eyes glowed red. He wanted to save this loli.

But... Too far away!

Abomination had found the blonde loli and was steadily approaching her.

While he was thinking about the tragedy about to take place, an emotionless ethereal voice appeared in Wu Chen's mind.

[Ding. Detects that the host has an extremely strong obsession, the strongest playing system in all the heavens is open!] 

[Host: Wu Chen]

[Current playing character: None] 
[Current playing progress: 0] 
[Possession of characters: None] 
[Number of times left to play a character: 1]

The sudden sound made Wu Chen's pupils dilate slightly, and then his dark eyes shone with light!

A cheat skill has appeared!



Without the intention to study his cheat skills, nor the intention to chat with the system, he directly inwardly roared, 'Extract the playing character!' 

The most important thing at the moment is to save the blonde loli!

Wu Chen himself has no way to save her. He can only rely on the power of the cheat skill.

And based on the name of this system, he was probably able to guess that the system could let him play as any character within the heavens and the earth.

It could be a big boss or a weakling.
But no matter who it was, it must be stronger than Wu Chen, an ordinary person!

Sure enough, the ethereal voice in his head rang out again.

[Please choose from the collection of playing characters, the current options are Naruto, DC, Dragon Ball]

[Want to extract immediately?] 

[ Extract ] 

[Extraction successful, character unlocked from Naruto]

[System detection, first time with character extraction. BUFF 'Wishful thinking' applied.]

[Ding! Character extraction in progress ......]

As the system's words fell, a series of figures flashed in Wu Chen's mind.

Finally, an image rose in his mind of a figure wearing a white robe with red flames licking the bottom, a Konoha forehead protector strapped on.

Blonde hair, blue-eyed, spiky hair, and that handsome soft face brought a warm feeling. Under the robe was the tactical clothing worn only above the Konoha ninja, and at the back of the robe were five big shiny words 'Fourth generation Hokage'!

The fourth-generation Hokage, the golden flash of Konoha, Namikaze Minato!

Wu Chen was excited. The blonde loli will be safe now!

When it comes to views, the first impression is, of course, the best!


[Ding! Congratulations to the host who has won the character of Naruto's fourth-generation Hokage, Konohagakure!]

[Do you want to start playing?] 

[Reminder: Appearance of all the characters played by the host will be altered automatically]

Initially, Wu Chen was worried that he would need to dress up as Minato and dye his black hair blonde before he could start playing, but he didn't expect that he could actually transform directly.

So, he didn't hesitate and replied directly to the system, "Start playing!"
