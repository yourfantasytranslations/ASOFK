title: "Chapter 2: Encounter with Harry Potter"

Anyway, Zhang Hao finally had a new thing to pursue. He came to London early and found his cousin Cho Chang.
 
Cho Chang’s both parents were wizards. It was said that her father was working in the English Ministry of Magic, but his monthly salary was not that much.
 
The family of three lived in an ordinary apartment, and the conditions were neither good nor bad.
 
Cho Chang's family treated Zhang Hao very well, but Zhang Hao was embarrassed to trouble them. So he bought a villa in the suburbs and hired some servants to take care of it.
 
After settling down, Zhang Hao borrowed some magic books from Cho Chang and began to teach himself magic.
 
Today, Zhang Hao had learned a little practical magic with the help of the mysterious illusion.
 
He didn't have a magic wand, so he could only practice wandless casting.
 
This was a difficult task, so more time was needed for the same spell.
 
He was in the bedroom before, trying wandless casting the levitation spell.
 
It was a pity as it seemed to be almost meaningless.
 
"Zhang Hao! Hurry up and eat! Aren't my dishes delicious?"
 
Cho Chang didn't eat at all. It seemed that she was only cooking to make Zhang Hao give up breakfast.
 
Zhang Hao had seen through this black-bellied cousin these days!
 
How could Zhang Hao, who pursues the quality of life, bear this kind of grievance?
 
He slowly said, "Sis, your cooking skills are questionable at best. Let me show you how it's done!"
 
Cho Chang said with a dazed expression, "You can cook?"
 
Zhang Hao smiled and said, "What's so difficult about cooking? Wait!"
 
Cho Chang said quickly, "My dear cousin brother, let's just go to Diagon Alley! When we get there, I can treat you to a big meal."
 
Zhang Hao rolled his eyes and said, " Even if you invite me to a big meal, I will still be the one to pay in the end. What do you mean by ‘you’ will treat me?"
 
As her plan was revealed, Cho Chang said angrily, "Zhang Hao, you bastard, don't count on me to help you at Hogwarts!"
…
Half an hour later, Cho Chang pleaded Zhang Hao with puppy eyes, "Cousin, would you please make some more? I still want to eat!"
 
Of course the skills that Zhang Hao learned include culinary skills. To be honest, his culinary skills at this time were absolutely comparable to those of a state banquet chef.
 
Using cooking skills to conquer someone was something very basic!
 
But facing Cho Chang's request, Zhang Hao unceremoniously refused. He couldn't understand why, why the gentle, beautiful and generous girl in the original book became so dark-bellied and funny in reality?
 
At this point, he couldn't bear it. He pointed directly at her graceful waist and said, "My dear cousin, you might end up out of shape if you eat so much. Now you should take me to Diagon Alley!"
 
Cho Chang's cheeks turned hot, but recalling the aftertaste in her mouth, she couldn't help but plead.
 
The result was obvious. Zhang Hao who was addicted to magic and cannot extricate himself from it didn’t agree to any outrageous requests.
 
In the end, Cho Chang could only take her resentment with Zhang Hao to Diagon Alley.
 
Diagon Alley was the most prosperous commercial street in the wizarding world in the UK. Many first-line brand stores in the wizarding world had ‘flagship stores’ here.
 
It was hidden in a small patio behind the Leaky Cauldron Bar that cannot be seen by Muggles in London. It could be accessed by hitting a specific wall tile next to the trash can with a magic wand.
 
Obviously, a quasi-wizard like Zhang Hao—who didn't even have a wand—wouldn't be able to enter Diagon Alley without anyone’s help.
 
Even someone like Cho Chang was having trouble before this wall. She used her magic wand to click on the specific wall tiles in the order she remembered.
 
But nothing happened…
 
Zhang Hao gradually became concerned. He watched Cho Chang trying multiple times, and couldn't help saying, "Cousin, maybe you should find an acquaintance to help? There should be a senior you know in the Leaky Cauldron?"
 
Cho Chang shook her head, and said with a slight embarrassment, "No, I just have to try again! Trust me!"
 
Zhang Hao helplessly shrugged and let Cho Chang perform. He was a little skeptical, ‘Aren't Ravenclaw students all academic masters? Why was his cousin so inferior?’
 
At this time, someone else came to the small patio.
Zhang Hao turned around and saw a strong man taller than an NBA giant pulling a thin boy into the door.
 
These two were Harry Potter and Hagrid.
 
Harry was obviously here for the first time, and seemed to be curious about everything.
 
Hagrid obviously did not expect someone to be blocked here, he said kindly, "Hey! Children, are you having any difficulties?"
 
Zhang Hao said in fluent English, "Yes sir, we are blocked by this wall. Can you help us?"
 
The contrast between the two eleven-year-old boys were apparent; Harry looked restrained, and Zhang Hao looked very confident.
 
The wealth of an incomparable country, rich survival skills, and complicated life experiences, all these hybrids together give Zhang Hao an unparalleled aura.
 
Although he was asking, Hagrid felt like he had to obey.
 
Harry had only met Zhang Hao for the first time, and he had an inexplicable inferiority complex from the bottom of his heart. He stared directly at Zhang Hao, with a sense of awe in his eyes.
 
Even Hagrid was slightly surprised, he said hurriedly, "Oh! No problem, just leave this to me!"
 
With the presence of outsiders, Cho Chang suddenly seemed to have changed herself. She immediately gave up the unnecessary attempt, and said, "I'm sorry! I forgot how to open the door!"
Hagrid smiled honestly, "Uh! This is normal. This door is really troublesome. It will be fine if you visit it a few more times. Let me do it this time!"
