"Slap!!!"

Intense pain ran through my cheeks. I collapsed on the spot by the impact of that slap.

‘What happened? Why am I being beaten?!’

The man who had no idea why he was being beaten looks around and tried to sort out the situation. Amidst his confusion he raised his head, and noticed another man approaching towards him.

A man with bright red hair and a stubborn face looked down at the beaten man with an angry expression on his face.

‘Who? Maybe this guy hit me?!

I know who I was hit, but I didn't know the reason behind this. And it seemed that the story wasn't over, yet.

 "Listen carefully! Never get involved with Claris again! And don’t show us your presence to us. Disappear!"

"Ouch ouch ouch ..."

The man sitting on the ground made a pitiful voice after being beaten by too many swordsmen.

‘Why am I so angry…’

"Hmm!"

The angry red-haired man heard the man sitting down stared at the man sitting down. Snorted with anger, then disappeared.

With this, the man who was sitting till now stood up and tied to confirm his situation.

When I looked around again, I noticed boys and girls dressed in clothes I had never seen before.

‘What’s this…’

Moreover, on a closer look he noticed that the venue was like a live venue and there were many people seated in the audience seats.

The increasingly confused man took a deep breath to calm down his mind.

‘Calm down, calm down, calm down. First of all, why is this happening? Let's remember what happened today!’

First, the man remembered what he was doing before he getting beaten by those people.

‘Hmmm, I am I was playing Fate 48 the blockbuster and recently trending eroge game.’

Fate 48, was a R18 eroge game released by a well-established company that wanted to make a masterpiece that would make a name for itself in the history.

What's more amazing is that it was created with forty-eight scenario writers and forty-eight illustrators. The huge production cost left even the consumers speechless with astonishment.

Furthermore, with paid DLC (Downloadable Content) increased the number of heroines to be captured in additional scenarios.

And in the end players can capture as many as 64 heroines in the game.

‘I was surprised when it was released. I was a famous scenario writer and a god painter, and it was a lot of excitement for me at that time. But I was a student so I couldn't buy it!’

But when I became a member of society I bought it with a starting salary. I was very happy on that day.

‘Yes, I used to play Fate 48 all night on long vacations. I even bought the paid DLC and conquered all the 64 heroines. Then I fell asleep…’

Finally, the recollection ended and the man arrived at his answer.

‘This is a dream!’

The solution was very simple to this problem. All he had to do was to wake up from this dream
Immediately, he pinched his cheeks to check whether it’s a dream or not. But, the result didn’t come as he had expected. The pain he felt at that time was real!!

"Leold Harvest!"

A loud voice suddenly echoed. The man's shoulders shook with fear. It's a name he had heard many times before.
Because the name was--

"I'm Leold Harvest ...!"

Because it was the underdog character that appears in the eroge game, Fate 48.
He probably hadn't have thought that he would become a reincarnation in another world, which he often reads in manga and web novel.

‘Wait, wait!! Leold was the character who got expelled from the school and got banished to the frontier after losing the duel to the main character Siegfried in the early stages. Moreover, depending on the capture heroine, he will be the last boss, and his death is confirmed, in all scenarios.’

‘And I don't want to die!!’

No matter how much I screamed in my heart, the reality was ruthless. A yelling voice continued to echoed deep within my heart.

"What are you doing?! Leold Harvest! You lost the duel.  Go back to your room immediately!"

"Yes ..."

I had no energy to resist.

Now I was just thinking about what to do in this situation.

Masato, who was now Leold was troubled by the fact that his death has been confirmed.

‘What should I do?!’

Leold, also known as Masato Sendo, returned to his room and pondered while lying on his bed.

All the scenarios were in my head because I had completely cleared Fate 48. That's why Masato was troubled by his confirmed death.

I had no idea how to live in the future. Since I will die anyway, I wanted to live a live as I pleased.

He was just uneasy about one factor.

"Is there a coercive force in the world?"

I have seen it many times in web novels, the coercive force of the world. If you try to resist the fate that was supposed to die, then the world will make you die.

Leold thought he wasn’t any exception. That's why he was worried .

"What if I were to die now? I can't do that. I don't have the guts.”

Although he muttered this desperately, he did not have the courage to do it. He rolled around on the bed, and time passed by without him being able to think of a solution.

Suddenly, Leold got out his bed, and thought ‘I don't know how much time has passed.’

Masato saw Leold's body in the mirror placed in his room.

"It’s the exact body as shown in the illustration. It's full of meat and has no jaws. He was often called as the Golden pig of the game."

Leold was a high-ranking duke, and at the same time had a strong self-esteem and an arrogant personality.

Thanks to that, he had lived to the best of his life. He was called the Golden pig because of his fat figure and golden hairs.

Masato sighed and sat on a chair. Looking at the ceiling, Leold remembered his performance.

"I've decided… I'm going to survive this at all costs! I don't care about the mysterious force of this world. This one has the power to be the last boss!

He thrust his hand upward and grasped the void. Leold knew the potential that was hidden within him. He was determined to use them to survive, in this new world.
