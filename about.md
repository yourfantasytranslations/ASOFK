Lu Wen was reborn as a bionic housekeeper.

He thought he would do just simple housework in this life.

On the first day he was taken home by his employer, he received two instructions:

“Don’t go to the third floor.”

“Dig a hole in the backyard that can bury an adult, and dig a little deeper.”

What should he do now? Is this fate of MC?
